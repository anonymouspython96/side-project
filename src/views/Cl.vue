    <h2>Dear Hiring Manager,</h2>

    <p>
      I am writing to express my interest in the Junior Front-End Web Developer
      position at Joinrs. With a background in web development, a Bachelorâ€™s
      degree in Computer Science from First Tech Academy (Boolean - Italy), and
      hands-on experience at WeGlad, I am eager to contribute to your team and
      grow within an innovative and supportive environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      During my time at WeGlad, I had the opportunity to develop and optimize
      responsive user interfaces using media queries, ensuring consistency
      across various screen sizes. My proficiency in React.js, Vue.js, and
      modern web technologies enabled me to collaborate with the team to design
      and implement user-friendly web solutions, while adhering to best UI/UX
      practices. I also worked on optimizing website performance and improving
      the user experience by resolving technical issues and debugging code.
    </p>

    <p>
      My project portfolio showcases my skills in front-end development,
      including building a personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS,
      JavaScript, and Vue.js. I also focus on ensuring responsive design,
      accessibility, and performance optimization. You can find further examples
      of my work on my GitHub profile.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am particularly drawn to Joinrs because of your commitment to supporting
      recent graduates and junior professionals in starting their careers with
      optimism and growth opportunities. The flexibility of working remotely,
      along with the training and mentorship offered by your team, is exactly
      the kind of environment I am eager to join.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am confident that my skills in web development, coupled with my passion
      for learning and growing, would allow me to contribute meaningfully to
      Joinrs. I am excited about the possibility of working with your team and
      contributing to your mission of supporting the aspirations of millions of
      users.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the
      opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to Joinrs' success.
    </p>
